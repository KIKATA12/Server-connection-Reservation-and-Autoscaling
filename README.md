# Reservation-Aware Server Connection Pooling API with Adaptive Auto-Scaling

## Overview
Traditional database connection pooling strategies fail under high concurrency, leading to
blocked requests, starvation, and scaling pressure. This project introduces a
reservation-aware API that issues tokens to queued clients, prioritizes retries, and denies
abusive requests. Unlike static pooling, this approach adds fairness, resilience, visibility, and
safeguards.
Building on this foundation, the project integrates predictive auto-scaling using Prometheus
metrics, a neural network (NeuralScaler), and a ScalingFactor class with logarithmic scaling.
This ensures proactive resource allocation while preserving stability. Kubernetes integration
allows replicas to be adjusted dynamically based on prediction strength and resource
constraints.
